# Flutter Text Height Example


Font Height Playground, assign different values and see how render changes.

Main purpose is to show how default `TextLeadingDistribution.proportional` 
flutter text behavior is different from Figma text height behavior, which 
could be enabled with `TextLeadingDistribution.even`.
### Though leading distribution behavior update seems to be bugged in text widget
